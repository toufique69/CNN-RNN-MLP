## IMDB movie review sentiment classification with RNNs
In this notebook, we'll train a recurrent neural network (RNN) for sentiment classification
using Tensorflow (version $\ge$ 2.0 required) with the Keras API. This notebook is largely
based on the Understanding recurrent neural networks by Fran√ßois Chollet.
