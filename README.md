# CNN-RNN-MLP

## MNIST handwritten digits classification with MLPs
In this notebook, we trained a multi-layer perceptron model to classify MNIST digits using TensorFlow (version $\ge$ 2.0 required) with the Keras API.

## MNIST handwritten digits classification with CNNs
In this notebook, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN, ConvNet) to classify MNIST digits using Tensorflow (version $\ge$ 2.0 required) with the Keras API.
This notebook builds on the MNIST-MLP notebook, so the recommended order is to go through the MNIST-MLP notebook before starting with this one.

## IMDB movie review sentiment classification with RNNs
In this notebook, we trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) for sentiment classification using Tensorflow (version $\ge$ 2.0 required) with the Keras API. This notebook is largely based on the Understanding recurrent neural networks by Fran√ßois Chollet.
